.Sh NAME
.Nm gotd
.Nd Game of Trees Daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Op Fl f Ar config-file
.Op Fl s Ar secrets
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a Git repository server which listens on a
.Xr unix 4
socket and relies on its companion tool
.Xr gotsh 1
to handle Git-protocol communication over the network, via
.Xr ssh 1 .
.Pp
The Git repository format is described in
.Xr git-repository 5 .
.Pp
.Nm
requires a configuration file in order to run.
The configuration file format is described in
.Xr gotd.conf 5 .
.Pp
It is recommended to restrict
.Xr ssh 1
features available to users of
.Nm .
See
.Xr gotsh 1
for details.
.Pp
The options for
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
Send log output to stderr.
.It Fl f Ar config-file
Set the path to the configuration file.
If not specified, the file
.Pa /etc/gotd.conf
will be used.
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl s Ar secrets
Set the path to the secrets file.
If not specified, the file
.Pa /etc/gotd-secrets.conf
will be used if it exists.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Verbosity increases if this option is used multiple times.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Pa /etc/gotd.conf
Default location of the configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/gotd.sock
Default location of the unix socket which
.Nm
is listening on.
This path can be configured in
.Xr gotd.conf 5 .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create an empty repository to be served by
.Nm ,
ensuring that it can only be accessed by the _gotd user:
.Pp
.Dl # mkdir -p /git/myrepo.git
.Dl # chmod 700 /git/myrepo.git
.Dl # chown _gotd /git/myrepo.git
.Dl # su -m _gotd -c 'gotadmin init /git/myrepo.git'
.Pp
Add the new repository to
.Xr gotd.conf 5
granting read-write access to the flan_hacker user account, and
restart
.Nm :
.Pp
.Dl # cat >> /etc/gotd.conf <<EOF
.Dl repository 'myrepo' {
.Dl path '/git/myrepo.git'
.Dl permit rw flan_hacker
.Dl }
.Dl EOF
.Dl # rcctl restart gotd
.Pp
The flan_hacker user can now populate the empty repository with
.Cm got send .

.Sh CAVEATS
At present,
.Nm
cannot serve repositories that use the sha256 object ID hashing algorithm
because
.Nm
does not yet support version 2 of the Git network protocol.
.Pp
.Nm
cannot honour the SIGHUP signal because the
.Pa /etc/gotd-secrets.conf
file is only readable by root, and
.Nm
runs entirely without root privileges after initial startup.
The configuration of a running
.Nm
instance can be reloaded by running
.Cm gotctl reload
as root.
