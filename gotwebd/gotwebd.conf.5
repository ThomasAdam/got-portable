.Sh NAME
.Nm gotwebd.conf
.Nd gotwebd configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the run-time configuration file for
.Xr gotwebd 8 .
.Pp
The file format is line-based, with one configuration directive per line.
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Arguments names not beginning with a letter, digit or underscore,
as well as reserved words
.Pq such as Ic listen , Ic server No or Ic user ,
must be quoted.
Arguments containing whitespace should be surrounded by double quotes
.Pq \&" .
.Pp
Macros can be defined that are later expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore, and may
contain any of those characters, but may not be reserved words.
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lan_addr = "192.168.0.1"
listen on $lan_addr port 9090
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
The available global configuration directives are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic chroot Ar path
Set the path to the
.Xr chroot 2
environment of
.Xr httpd 8 .
If not specified, it defaults to
.Pa /var/www ,
the home directory of the www user.
Setting the
.Ar path
to
.Pa /
effectively disables chroot.
.It Ic listen on Ar address Ic port Ar number
Configure an address and port for incoming FastCGI connections.
Valid
.Ar address
arguments are hostnames, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
The
.Ar port
argument may be number or a service name defined in
.Xr services 5 .
May be specified multiple times to build up a list of listening sockets.
.It Ic listen on socket Ar path
Configure a
.Ux Ns -domain
socket for incoming FastCGI connections.
May be specified multiple times to build up a list of listening sockets.
.Pp
While the specified
.Ar path
must be absolute, it should usually point inside the web server's chroot
directory such that the web server can access the socket.
.It Ic prefork Ar number
Run the specified number of server processes.
.Xr gotwebd 8
runs 3 server processes by default.
.It Ic user Ar user
Set the
.Ar user
which will run
.Xr gotwebd 8 .
If not specified, the user _gotwebd will be used.
.It Ic www user Ar user
Set the
.Ar user
which runs
.Xr httpd 8 .
Needed to ensure that the web server can access UNIX-domain sockets created by
.Xr gotwebd 8 .
If not specified, the user www will be used.
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ic listen
directive is used,
.Xr gotwebd 8
will listen on the
.Ux Ns -domain
socket at
.Pa /var/www/run/gotweb.sock .
.Sh SERVER CONFIGURATION
At least one server context must exist for
.Xr gotwebd 8
to function.
In case no server context is defined in the configuration file, a default
server context will be used which uses default parameters for all
applicable settings.
.Pp
A server context is declared with a unique
.Ar name ,
followed by server-specific configuration directives inside curly braces:
.Pp
.Ic server Ar name Brq ...
.Pp
The first server defined is used if the requested hostname is not
matched by any server block.
.Pp
The available server configuration directives are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic custom_css Ar path
Set the path to a custom Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) to be used.
If this option is not specified then the default style sheet
.Sq gotweb.css
will be used.
.Pp
This path must be valid in the web server's URL space since browsers
will attempt to fetch it.
.It Ic logo Ar path
Set the path to an image file containing a logo to be displayed.
Defaults to
.Sq got.png .
.Pp
This path must be valid in the web server's URL space since browsers
will attempt to fetch it.
.It Ic logo_url Ar url
Set a hyperlink for the logo.
Defaults to
.Lk https://gameoftrees.org .
.It Ic max_commits_display Ar number
Set the maximum amount of commits and tags displayed per page.

Defaults to 25.
Set to zero to show all the repositories without pagination.
.It Ic repos_path Ar path
Set the path to the directory which contains Git repositories that
the server should publish.
This path is absolute.
Repositories can be served even if they reside outside the web server's
chroot directory.
.Pp
Defaults to
.Pa /got/public
inside the web server's chroot directory.
The
.Cm chroot
directive must be used before the server declaration in order to
take effect.
.It Ic respect_exportok Ar on | off
Set whether to display the repository only if it contains the magic
.Pa git-daemon-export-ok
file.
Disabled by default.
.It Ic show_repo_age Ar on | off
Toggle display of last repository modification date.
Enabled by default.
.It Ic show_repo_cloneurl Ar on | off
Toggle display of clone URLs for a repository.
This requires the creation of a
.Pa cloneurl
file inside the repository which contains one URL per line.
Enabled by default.
.It Ic show_repo_description Ar on | off
Toggle display of the repository description.
Enabled by default.
The
.Pa description
file in the repository should be updated with an appropriate description.
.It Ic show_repo_owner Ar on | off
Set whether to display the repository owner.
Enabled by default.
This requires the creation of an
.Pa owner
file in the repository or adding an
.Sq owner
field under the [gotweb] or [gitweb] section in the
.Pa config
file inside the repository.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[gotweb]
owner = "Your Name"
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Pa owner
file has priority over the
.Pa config
if present.
.It Ic site_link Ar string

Defaults to
.Sq Repos .
.It Ic site_name Ar string
Set the displayed site name title.

Defaults to 3.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Pa /etc/gotwebd.conf
Default location of the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Pa /var/www/run/gotweb.sock
Default location for the
.Xr gotwebd 8
listening socket.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
A sample configuration:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
www user "www"   # www username needs quotes since www is a keyword

server "localhost" {
	site_name	"my public repos"
	site_owner	"Flan Hacker"
	site_link	"Flan' Projects"
}
.Ed
.Pp
Another example, this time listening on a local port instead of the
implicit
.Ux
socket, and serving repositories located outside the web server's chroot:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listen on 127.0.0.1 port 9000
listen on ::1 port 9000

server "localhost" {
	site_name	"my public repos"
	repos_path	"/var/git"
}
