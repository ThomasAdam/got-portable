Running gotsysd regression tests requires some manual system preparation.

vmd(8) must be running:

  # rcctl enable vmd
  # rcctl start vmd

pf(4) must be configured to pass traffic from the default guest IP range
to the internet. Assuming the default route interface is em0, this line
in /etc/pf.conf should work:

  match out on em0 from "100.64.0.0/10" nat-to (em0)

pf(4) must be configured to pass DNS requests from the guest IP range
to a working DNS resolver:

  match in on tap inet proto udp from "100.64.0.0/10" to any \
	port domain rdr-to 127.0.0.1

Replace 127.0.0.1 with your preferred resolver.

The pf(4) ruleset must be reloaded:

  # pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

IP forwarding must be enabled for IPv4 traffic:

  # sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

The test suite defaults to the virtual machine name: gotsysd-test
This name can be passed to vmctl(8) to control the VM.

The tests require a base disk image which is used to avoid running a
full VM installation for each run of the tests. The base image must be
created manually by performing a scripted autoinstall(8) installation:

  # make vm

The base disk image will be removed by 'make clean'.

Once the installation has completed, wait until the guest has booted into
the installed system. Once the installed system has booted successfully,
the VM can be shut down from the host:

  # vmctl stop gotsysd-test

Now the actual test suite can be run with:

  # make

A test VM will be started automatically and stopped again once the tests
have finished running.
