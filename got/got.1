.Sh NAME
.Nm got
.Nd Game of Trees
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hV
.Ar command
.Op Ar arg ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a version control system which stores the history of tracked files
in a Git repository, as used by the Git version control system.
This repository format is described in
.Xr git-repository 5 .
.Pp
.Nm
is a
.Dq distributed
version control system because every copy of a repository is writeable.
Modifications made to files can be synchronized between repositories
at any time.
.Pp
Files managed by
.Nm
must be checked out from the repository for modification.
Checked out files are stored in a
.Em work tree
which can be placed at an arbitrary directory in the filesystem hierarchy.
The on-disk format of this work tree is described in
.Xr got-worktree 5 .
.Pp
.Nm
provides global and command-specific options.
Global options must precede the command name, and are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width tenletters
.It Fl h
Display usage information and exit immediately.
.It Fl V , -version
Display program version and exit immediately.
.El
.Pp
The commands for
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width checkout
.Tg im
.It Xo
.Cm import
.Op Fl b Ar branch
.Op Fl I Ar pattern
.Op Fl m Ar message
.Op Fl r Ar repository-path
.Ar directory
.Xc
.Dl Pq alias: Cm im
Create an initial commit in a repository from the file hierarchy
within the specified
.Ar directory .
The created commit will not have any parent commits, i.e. it will be a
root commit.
Also create a new reference which provides a branch name for the newly
created commit.
Show the path of each imported file to indicate progress.
.Pp
The
.Cm got import
command requires the
.Ev GOT_AUTHOR
environment variable to be set,
unless an author has been configured in
.Xr got.conf 5
or Git's
.Dv user.name
and
.Dv user.email
configuration settings can be obtained from the repository's
.Pa .git/config
file or from Git's global
.Pa ~/.gitconfig
configuration file.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got import
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar branch
Create the specified
.Ar branch .
If this option is not specified, a branch corresponding to the repository's
HEAD reference will be used.
Use of this option is required if the branch resolved via the repository's
HEAD reference already exists.
.It Fl I Ar pattern
Ignore files or directories with a name which matches the specified
.Ar pattern .
This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of ignore patterns.
The
.Ar pattern
follows the globbing rules documented in
.Xr glob 7 .
.It Fl m Ar message
Use the specified log message when creating the new commit.
Without the
.Fl m
option,
.Cm got import
opens a temporary file in an editor where a log message can be written.
.It Fl r Ar repository-path
Use the repository at the specified path.
If not specified, assume the repository is located at or above the current
working directory.
.El
.Tg cl
.It Xo
.Cm clone
.Op Fl almqv
.Op Fl b Ar branch
.Op Fl R Ar reference
.Ar repository-URL
.Op Ar directory
.Xc
.Dl Pq alias: Cm cl
Clone a Git repository at the specified
.Ar repository-URL
into the specified
.Ar directory .
If no
.Ar directory
is specified, the directory name will be derived from the name of the
cloned repository.
.Cm got clone
will refuse to run if the
.Ar directory
already exists.
.Pp
The
.Ar repository-URL
specifies a protocol scheme, a server hostname, an optional port number
separated from the hostname by a colon, and a path to the repository on
the server:
.Lk scheme://hostname:port/path/to/repository
.Pp
The following protocol schemes are supported:
.Bl -tag -width git+ssh
.It git
The Git protocol as implemented by the
.Xr git-daemon 1
server.
Use of this protocol is discouraged since it supports neither authentication
nor encryption.
.It git+ssh
The Git protocol wrapped in an authenticated and encrypted
.Xr ssh 1
tunnel.
With this protocol the hostname may contain an embedded username for
.Xr ssh 1
to use:
.Mt user@hostname
.It ssh
Short alias for git+ssh.
.El
.Pp
Objects in the cloned repository are stored in a pack file which is downloaded
from the server.
This pack file will then be indexed to facilitate access to the objects stored
within.
If any objects in the pack file are stored in deltified form, all deltas will
be fully resolved in order to compute the ID of such objects.
This can take some time.
More details about the pack file format are documented in
.Xr git-repository 5 .
.Pp
.Cm got clone
creates a remote repository entry in the
.Xr got.conf 5
and
.Pa config
files of the cloned repository to store the
.Ar repository-url
and any
.Ar branch
or
.Ar reference
arguments for future use by
.Cm got fetch
or
.Xr git-fetch 1 .
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got clone
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Fetch all branches from the remote repository's
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace and set
.Cm fetch_all_branches
in the cloned repository's
.Xr got.conf 5
file for future use by
.Cm got fetch .
If this option is not specified, a branch resolved via the remote
repository's HEAD reference will be fetched.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl b
option.
.It Fl b Ar branch
Fetch the specified
.Ar branch
from the remote repository's
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace.
This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of branches
to fetch.
If the branch corresponding to the remote repository's HEAD reference is not
in this list, the cloned repository's HEAD reference will be set to the first
branch which was fetched.
If this option is not specified, a branch resolved via the remote
repository's HEAD reference will be fetched.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl a
option.
.It Fl l
List branches and tags available for fetching from the remote repository
and exit immediately.
Cannot be used together with any of the other options except
.Fl q
and
.Fl v .
.It Fl m
Create the cloned repository as a mirror of the original repository.
This is useful if the cloned repository will not be used to store
locally created commits.
.Pp
The repository's
.Xr got.conf 5
and
.Pa config
files will be set up with the
.Dq mirror
option enabled, such that
.Cm got fetch
or
.Xr git-fetch 1
will write incoming changes directly to branches in the
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace, rather than to branches in the
.Dq refs/remotes/
namespace.
This avoids the usual requirement of having to run
.Cm got rebase
after
.Cm got fetch
in order to make incoming changes appear on branches in the
.Dq refs/heads/
namespace.
But maintaining custom changes in the cloned repository becomes difficult
since such changes will be at risk of being discarded whenever incoming
changes are fetched.
.It Fl q
Suppress progress reporting output.
The same option will be passed to
.Xr ssh 1
if applicable.
.It Fl R Ar reference
In addition to the branches and tags that will be fetched, fetch an arbitrary
.Ar reference
from the remote repository's
.Dq refs/
namespace.
This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of additional
references to fetch.
The specified
.Ar reference
may either be a path to a specific reference, or a reference namespace
which will cause all references in this namespace to be fetched.
.Pp
Each reference will be mapped into the cloned repository's
.Dq refs/remotes/
namespace, unless the
.Fl m
option is used to mirror references directly into the cloned repository's
.Dq refs/
namespace.
.Pp
.Cm got clone
will refuse to fetch references from the remote repository's
.Dq refs/remotes/
or
.Dq refs/got/
namespace.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Causes
.Cm got clone
to print debugging messages to standard error output.
This option will be passed to
.Xr ssh 1
if applicable.
Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.
The maximum is 3.
.El
.Tg fe
.It Xo
.Cm fetch
.Op Fl adlqtvX
.Op Fl b Ar branch
.Op Fl R Ar reference
.Op Fl r Ar repository-path
.Op Ar remote-repository
.Xc
.Dl Pq alias: Cm fe
Fetch new changes from a remote repository.
If no
.Ar remote-repository
is specified,
.Dq origin
will be used.
The remote repository's URL is obtained from the corresponding entry in
.Xr got.conf 5
or Git's
.Pa config
file of the local repository, as created by
.Cm got clone .
.Pp
New changes will be stored in a separate pack file downloaded from the server.
Optionally, separate pack files stored in the repository can be combined with
.Xr git-repack 1 .
.Pp
By default, branch references in the
.Dq refs/remotes/
reference namespace will be updated to point at the newly fetched commits.
The
.Cm got rebase
command can then be used to make new changes visible on branches in the
.Dq refs/heads/
namespace, merging incoming changes with the changes on those branches
as necessary.
.Pp
If the repository was created as a mirror with
.Cm got clone -m ,
then all branches in the
.Dq refs/heads/
namespace will be updated directly to match the corresponding branches in
the remote repository.
If those branches contained local commits, these commits will no longer be
reachable via a reference and will therefore be at risk of being discarded
by Git's garbage collector or
.Cm gotadmin cleanup .
Maintaining custom changes in a mirror repository is therefore discouraged.
.Pp
In any case, references in the
.Dq refs/tags/
namespace will always be fetched and mapped directly to local references
in the same namespace.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got fetch
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Fetch all branches from the remote repository's
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace.
This option can be enabled by default for specific repositories in
.Xr got.conf 5 .
If this option is not specified, the work tree's current branch
will be fetched if invoked within a work tree,
otherwise a branch resolved via the remote repository's HEAD reference
will be fetched.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl b
option.
.It Fl b Ar branch
Fetch the specified
.Ar branch
from the remote repository's
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace.
This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of branches
to fetch.
If this option is not specified, the work tree's current branch
will be fetched if invoked within a work tree,
otherwise a branch resolved via the remote repository's HEAD reference
will be fetched.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl a
option.
.It Fl d
Delete branches and tags from the local repository which are no longer
present in the remote repository.
Only references are deleted.
Any commit, tree, tag, and blob objects belonging to deleted branches or
tags remain in the repository and may be removed separately with
Git's garbage collector or
.Cm gotadmin cleanup .
.It Fl l
List branches and tags available for fetching from the remote repository
and exit immediately.
Cannot be used together with any of the other options except
.Fl v ,
.Fl q ,
and
.Fl r .
.It Fl q
Suppress progress reporting output.
The same option will be passed to
.Xr ssh 1
if applicable.
.It Fl R Ar reference
In addition to the branches and tags that will be fetched, fetch an arbitrary
.Ar reference
from the remote repository's
.Dq refs/
namespace.
This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of additional
references to fetch.
The specified
.Ar reference
may either be a path to a specific reference, or a reference namespace
which will cause all references in this namespace to be fetched.
.Pp
Each reference will be mapped into the local repository's
.Dq refs/remotes/
namespace, unless the local repository was created as a mirror with
.Cm got clone -m
in which case references will be mapped directly into the local repository's
.Dq refs/
namespace.
.Pp
Once a reference has been fetched, a branch based on it can be created with
.Cm got branch
if needed.
.Pp
.Cm got fetch
will refuse to fetch references from the remote repository's
.Dq refs/remotes/
or
.Dq refs/got/
namespace.
.It Fl r Ar repository-path
Use the repository at the specified path.
If not specified, assume the repository is located at or above the current
working directory.
If this directory is a
.Nm
work tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.
.It Fl t
Allow existing references in the
.Dq refs/tags
namespace to be updated if they have changed on the server.
If not specified, only new tag references will be created.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Causes
.Cm got fetch
to print debugging messages to standard error output.
The same option will be passed to
.Xr ssh 1
if applicable.
Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.
The maximum is 3.
.It Fl X
Delete all references which correspond to a particular
.Ar remote-repository
instead of fetching new changes.
This can be useful when a remote repository is being removed from
.Xr got.conf 5 .
.Pp
With
.Fl X ,
the
.Ar remote-repository
argument is mandatory and no other options except
.Fl r ,
.Fl v ,
and
.Fl q
are allowed.
.Pp
Only references are deleted.
Any commit, tree, tag, and blob objects fetched from a remote repository
will generally be stored in pack files and may be removed separately with
.Xr git-repack 1
and Git's garbage collector.

.Xc
.Dl Pq alias: Cm co
Copy files from a repository into a new work tree.
Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It A Ta new file was added
.It E Ta file already exists in work tree's meta-data
.El
.Pp
If the
.Ar work tree path
is not specified, either use the last component of
.Ar repository path ,
or if a
.Ar path prefix
was specified use the last component of
.Ar path prefix .
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got checkout
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar branch
Check out files from a commit on the specified
.Ar branch .
If this option is not specified, a branch resolved via the repository's HEAD
reference will be used.
.It Fl c Ar commit
Check out files from the specified
.Ar commit
on the selected branch.
The expected argument is a commit ID SHA1 hash or an existing reference
or tag name which will be resolved to a commit ID.
An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full SHA1 hash
automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.
If this option is not specified, the most recent commit on the selected
branch will be used.
.Pp
If the specified
.Ar commit
is not contained in the selected branch, a different branch which contains
this commit must be specified with the
.Fl b
option.
If no such branch is known, a new branch must be created for this
commit with
.Cm got branch
before
.Cm got checkout
can be used.
Checking out work trees with an unknown branch is intentionally not supported.
.It Fl E
Proceed with the checkout operation even if the directory at
.Ar work-tree-path
is not empty.
Existing files will be left intact.
.It Fl p Ar path-prefix
Restrict the work tree to a subset of the repository's tree hierarchy.
Only files beneath the specified
.Ar path-prefix
will be checked out.
.It Fl q
Silence progress output.
.El
.Tg up
.It Xo
.Cm update
.Op Fl q

.Xc
.Dl Pq alias: Cm up
Update an existing work tree to a different
.Ar commit .
Change existing files in the work tree as necessary to match file contents
of this commit.
Preserve any local changes in the work tree and merge them with the
incoming changes.
.Pp
Files which already contain merge conflicts will not be updated to avoid
further complications.
Such files will be updated when
.Cm got update
is run again after merge conflicts have been resolved.
If the conflicting changes are no longer needed, affected files can be
reverted with
.Cm got revert
before running
.Cm got update
again.
.Pp
Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It U Ta file was updated and contained no local changes
.It G Ta file was updated and local changes were merged cleanly
.It C Ta file was updated and conflicts occurred during merge
.It D Ta file was deleted
.It A Ta new file was added
.It \(a~ Ta versioned file is obstructed by a non-regular file
.It ! Ta a missing versioned file was restored
.It # Ta file was not updated because it contains merge conflicts
.It ? Ta changes destined for an unversioned file were not merged
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar path
is specified, update the entire work tree.
Otherwise, restrict the update operation to files at or within the
specified paths.
Each path is required to exist in the update operation's target commit.
Files in the work tree outside specified paths will remain unchanged and
will retain their previously recorded base commit.
Some
.Nm
commands may refuse to run while the work tree contains files from
multiple base commits.
The base commit of such a work tree can be made consistent by running
.Cm got update
across the entire work tree.
Specifying a
.Ar path
is incompatible with the
.Fl b
option.
.Pp
.Cm got update
cannot update paths with staged changes.
If changes have been staged with
.Cm got stage ,
these changes must first be committed with
.Cm got commit
or unstaged with
.Cm got unstage .
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got update
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar branch
Switch the work tree's branch reference to the specified
.Ar branch
before updating the work tree.
This option requires that all paths in the work tree are updated.
.Pp
As usual, any local changes in the work tree will be preserved.
This can be useful when switching to a newly created branch in order
to commit existing local changes to this branch.
.Pp
Any local changes must be dealt with separately in order to obtain a
work tree with pristine file contents corresponding exactly to the specified
.Ar branch .
Such changes could first be committed to a different branch with
.Cm got commit ,
or could be discarded with
.Cm got revert .
.It Fl c Ar commit
Update the work tree to the specified
.Ar commit .
The expected argument is a commit ID SHA1 hash or an existing reference
or tag name which will be resolved to a commit ID.
An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full SHA1 hash
automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.
If this option is not specified, the most recent commit on the work tree's
branch will be used.
.It Fl q
Silence progress output.

Show the current modification status of files in a work tree,
using the following status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It M Ta modified file
.It A Ta file scheduled for addition in next commit
.It D Ta file scheduled for deletion in next commit
.It C Ta modified or added file which contains merge conflicts
.It ! Ta versioned file was expected on disk but is missing
.It \(a~ Ta versioned file is obstructed by a non-regular file
.It ? Ta unversioned item not tracked by
.Nm
.It m Ta modified file modes (executable bit only)
.It N Ta non-existent
.Ar path
specified on the command line
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar path
is specified, show modifications in the entire work tree.
Otherwise, show modifications at or within the specified paths.
.Pp
If changes have been staged with
.Cm got stage ,
staged changes are shown in the second output column, using the following
status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It M Ta file modification is staged
.It A Ta file addition is staged
.It D Ta file deletion is staged
.El
.Pp
Changes created on top of staged changes are indicated in the first column:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It MM Ta file was modified after earlier changes have been staged
.It MA Ta file was modified after having been staged for addition
.El
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got status
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl I
Show unversioned files even if they match an ignore pattern.
.It Fl S Ar status-codes
Suppress the output of files with a modification status matching any of the
single-character status codes contained in the
.Ar status-codes
argument.
Any combination of codes from the above list of possible status codes
may be specified.
For staged files, status codes displayed in either column will be matched.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl s
option.
.It Fl s Ar status-codes
Only show files with a modification status matching any of the
single-character status codes contained in the
.Ar status-codes
argument.
Any combination of codes from the above list of possible status codes
may be specified.
For staged files, status codes displayed in either column will be matched.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl S
option.
.El
.Pp
For compatibility with
.Xr cvs 1
and
.Xr git 1 ,
.Cm got status
reads
.Xr glob 7
patterns from
.Pa .cvsignore
and
.Pa .gitignore
files in each traversed directory and will not display unversioned files
which match these patterns.
As an extension to
.Xr glob 7
matching rules,
.Cm got status
supports consecutive asterisks,
.Dq ** ,
which will match an arbitrary amount of directories.
Unlike
.Xr cvs 1 ,
.Cm got status
only supports a single ignore pattern per line.
Unlike
.Xr git 1 ,
.Cm got status
does not support negated ignore patterns prefixed with
.Dq \&! ,
and gives no special significance to the location of path component separators,
.Dq / ,
in a pattern.

Display history of a repository.
If a
.Ar path
is specified, show only commits which modified this path.
If invoked in a work tree, the
.Ar path
is interpreted relative to the current working directory,
and the work tree's path prefix is implicitly prepended.
Otherwise, the path is interpreted relative to the repository root.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got log
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Display individual commits which were merged into the current branch
from other branches.
By default,
.Cm got log
shows the linear history of the current branch only.
.It Fl C Ar number
Set the number of context lines shown in diffs with
.Fl p .
By default, 3 lines of context are shown.
.It Fl c Ar commit
Start traversing history at the specified
.Ar commit .
The expected argument is a commit ID SHA1 hash or an existing reference
or tag name which will be resolved to a commit ID.
An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full SHA1 hash
automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.
If this option is not specified, default to the work tree's current branch
if invoked in a work tree, or to the repository's HEAD reference.
.It Fl d
Display diffstat of changes introduced in each commit.
Cannot be used with the
.Fl s
option.
.It Fl l Ar N
Limit history traversal to a given number of commits.
If this option is not specified, a default limit value of zero is used,
which is treated as an unbounded limit.
The
.Ev GOT_LOG_DEFAULT_LIMIT
environment variable may be set to change this default value.
.It Fl P
Display the list of file paths changed in each commit, using the following
status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It M Ta modified file
.It D Ta file was deleted
.It A Ta new file was added
.It m Ta modified file modes (executable bit only)
.El
.Pp
Cannot be used with the
.Fl s
option.
.It Fl p
Display the patch of modifications made in each commit.
If a
.Ar path
is specified, only show the patch of modifications at or within this path.
Cannot be used with the
.Fl s
option.
.It Fl R
Determine a set of commits to display as usual, but display these commits
in reverse order.
.It Fl r Ar repository-path
Use the repository at the specified path.
If not specified, assume the repository is located at or above the current
working directory.
If this directory is a
.Nm
work tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.
.It Fl S Ar search-pattern
If specified, show only commits with a log message, author name,
committer name, or ID SHA1 hash matched by the extended regular
expression
.Ar search-pattern .
Lines in committed patches will be matched if
.Fl p
is specified.
File paths changed by a commit will be matched if
.Fl P
is specified.
Regular expression syntax is documented in
.Xr re_format 7 .
.It Fl s
Display a short one-line summary of each commit, instead of the default
history format.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl p
or
.Fl P
option.
.It Fl x Ar commit
Stop traversing commit history immediately after the specified
.Ar commit
has been traversed.
This option has no effect if the specified
.Ar commit
is never traversed.

.Dl Pq alias: Cm di
When invoked within a work tree without any arguments, display all
local changes in the work tree.
If one or more
.Ar path
arguments are specified, only show changes within the specified paths.
.Pp
If two arguments are provided, treat each argument as a reference, a tag
name, or an object ID SHA1 hash, and display differences between the
corresponding objects.
Both objects must be of the same type (blobs, trees, or commits).
An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full SHA1 hash
automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.
If none of these interpretations produce a valid result or if the
.Fl P
option is used,
and if
.Cm got diff
is running in a work tree, attempt to interpret the two arguments as paths.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got diff
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Treat file contents as ASCII text even if binary data is detected.
.It Fl C Ar number
Set the number of context lines shown in the diff.
By default, 3 lines of context are shown.
.It Fl c Ar commit
Show differences between commits in the repository.
This option may be used up to two times.
When used only once, show differences between the specified
.Ar commit
and its first parent commit.
When used twice, show differences between the two specified commits.
.Pp
The expected argument is a commit ID SHA1 hash or an existing reference
or tag name which will be resolved to a commit ID.
An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full SHA1 hash
automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.
.Pp
If the
.Fl c
option is used, all non-option arguments will be interpreted as paths.
If one or more such
.Ar path
arguments are provided, only show differences for the specified paths.
.Pp
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl P
option.
.It Fl d
Display diffstat of changes before the actual diff by annotating each file path
or blob hash being diffed with the total number of lines added and removed.
A summary line will display the total number of changes across all files.

.Pp
References may be listed, created, deleted, and changed.
When creating, deleting, or changing a reference the specified
.Ar name
must be an absolute reference name, i.e. it must begin with
.Dq refs/ .
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got ref
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar object
Create a reference or change an existing reference.
The reference with the specified
.Ar name
will point at the specified

Create, list, or delete branches.
.Pp
Local branches are managed via references which live in the
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace.
The
.Cm got branch
command creates references in this namespace only.
.Pp
When deleting branches, the specified
.Ar name
is searched in the
.Dq refs/heads
reference namespace first.
If no corresponding branch is found, the
.Dq refs/remotes
namespace will be searched next.
.Pp
If invoked in a work tree without any arguments, print the name of the
work tree's current branch.
.Pp
If a
.Ar name
argument is passed, attempt to create a branch reference with the given name.
By default the new branch reference will point at the latest commit on the
work tree's current branch if invoked in a work tree, and otherwise to a commit
resolved via the repository's HEAD reference.
.Pp
If invoked in a work tree, once the branch was created successfully
switch the work tree's head reference to the newly created branch and
update files across the entire work tree, just like
.Cm got update -b Ar name
would do.
Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It U Ta file was updated and contained no local changes
.It G Ta file was updated and local changes were merged cleanly
.It C Ta file was updated and conflicts occurred during merge
.It D Ta file was deleted
.It A Ta new file was added
.It \(a~ Ta versioned file is obstructed by a non-regular file
.It ! Ta a missing versioned file was restored
.El
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got branch
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar commit
Make a newly created branch reference point at the specified
.Ar commit .
The expected
.Ar commit
argument is a commit ID SHA1 hash or an existing reference
or tag name which will be resolved to a commit ID.
.It Fl d Ar name
Delete the branch with the specified
.Ar name
from the
.Dq refs/heads
or
.Dq refs/remotes
reference namespace.
.Pp
Only the branch reference is deleted.
Any commit, tree, and blob objects belonging to the branch
remain in the repository and may be removed separately with
Git's garbage collector or
.Cm gotadmin cleanup .
.It Fl l
List all existing branches in the repository, including copies of remote
repositories' branches in the
.Dq refs/remotes/
reference namespace.
.Pp
If invoked in a work tree, the work tree's current branch is shown
with one the following annotations:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It * Ta work tree's base commit matches the branch tip
.It \(a~ Ta work tree's base commit is out-of-date
.El
.It Fl n
Do not switch and update the work tree after creating a new branch.
.It Fl r Ar repository-path
Use the repository at the specified path.
If not specified, assume the repository is located at or above the current
working directory.
If this directory is a
.Nm
work tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.
.It Fl t
Sort listed branches by modification time (most recently modified first)
instead of sorting by lexicographical order.
Branches in the
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace are listed before branches in
.Dq refs/remotes/
regardless.
Use of this option requires the

Manage tags in a repository.
.Pp
Tags are managed via references which live in the
.Dq refs/tags/
reference namespace.
The
.Cm got tag
command operates on references in this namespace only.
References in this namespace point at tag objects which contain a pointer
to another object, a tag message, as well as author and timestamp information.
.Pp
Attempt to create a tag with the given
.Ar name ,
and make this tag point at the given
.Ar commit .
If no commit is specified, default to the latest commit on the work tree's
current branch if invoked in a work tree, and to a commit resolved via
the repository's HEAD reference otherwise.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got tag
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar commit
Make the newly created tag reference point at the specified
.Ar commit .
The expected
.Ar commit
argument is a commit ID SHA1 hash or an existing reference or tag name which
will be resolved to a commit ID.
An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full SHA1 hash
automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.
.It Fl l
List all existing tags in the repository instead of creating a new tag.
If a
.Ar name
argument is passed, show only the tag with the given
.Ar name .
.It Fl m Ar message
Use the specified tag message when creating the new tag.
Without the
.Fl m
option,
.Cm got tag
opens a temporary file in an editor where a tag message can be written.
.It Fl r Ar repository-path
Use the repository at the specified path.
If not specified, assume the repository is located at or above the current
working directory.
If this directory is a
.Nm
work tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.
.It Fl s Ar signer-id
While creating a new tag, sign this tag with the identity given in
.Ar signer-id .
.Pp
For SSH-based signatures,
.Ar signer-id
is the path to a file which may refer to either a private SSH key,
or a public SSH key with the private half available via
.Xr ssh-agent 1 .
.Cm got tag
will sign the tag object by invoking
.Xr ssh-keygen 1
with the
.Fl Y Cm sign
command, using the signature namespace
.Dq git
for compatibility with
.Xr git 1 .
.It Fl V
Verify tag object signatures.
If a
.Ar name
is specified, show and verify the tag object with the provided name.
Otherwise, list all tag objects and verify signatures where present.
.Pp
.Cm got tag
verifies SSH-based signatures by invoking
.Xr ssh-keygen 1
with the options
.Fl Y Cm verify Fl f Ar allowed_signers .
A path to the
.Ar allowed_signers
file must be set in
.Xr got.conf 5 ,
otherwise verification is impossible.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
During SSH signature creation and verification this option will be passed to
.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.
The maximum is 3.
.El
.Pp
By design, the
.Cm got tag
command will not delete tags or change existing tags.
If a tag must be deleted, the
.Cm got ref
command may be used to delete a tag's reference.
This should only be done if the tag has not already been copied to
another repository.
.It Xo
.Cm add
.Op Fl IR
.Ar path ...

By default, files which match a
.Cm got status
ignore pattern will not be added.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got add
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl I
Add files even if they match a
.Cm got status
ignore pattern.
.It Fl R
Permit recursion into directories.
If this option is not specified,
.Cm got add
will refuse to run if a specified

.Xc
.Dl Pq alias: Cm rm
Remove versioned files from a work tree and schedule them for deletion
from the repository in the next commit.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got remove
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Perform the operation even if a file contains local modifications,
and do not raise an error if a specified
.Ar path
does not exist on disk.
.It Fl k
Keep affected files on disk.
.It Fl R
Permit recursion into directories.
If this option is not specified,
.Cm got remove
will refuse to run if a specified
.Ar path
is a directory.
.It Fl s Ar status-codes
Only delete files with a modification status matching one of the
single-character status codes contained in the
.Ar status-codes
argument.
The following status codes may be specified:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It M Ta modified file (this implies the

.Xc
.Dl Pq alias: Cm pa
Apply changes from
.Ar patchfile
to files in a work tree.
Files added or removed by a patch will be scheduled for addition or removal in
the work tree.
.Pp
The patch must be in the unified diff format as produced by
.Cm got diff ,
.Xr git-diff 1 ,
or by
.Xr diff 1
and
.Xr cvs 1
diff when invoked with their
.Fl u
options.
If no
.Ar patchfile
argument is provided, read unified diff data from standard input instead.
.Pp
If the
.Ar patchfile
contains multiple patches, then attempt to apply each of them in sequence.
.Pp
Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:
.Bl -column XYZ description
.It M Ta file was modified
.It G Ta file was merged using a merge-base found in the repository
.It C Ta file was merged and conflicts occurred during merge
.It D Ta file was deleted
.It A Ta file was added
.It # Ta failed to patch the file
.El
.Pp
If a change does not match at its exact line number, attempt to
apply it somewhere else in the file if a good spot can be found.
Otherwise, the patch will fail to apply.
.Pp
.Nm
.Cm patch
will refuse to apply a patch if certain preconditions are not met.
Files to be deleted must already be under version control, and must
not have been scheduled for deletion already.
Files to be added must not yet be under version control and must not
already be present on disk.
Files to be modified must already be under version control and may not
contain conflict markers.
.Pp
If an error occurs, the
.Cm patch
operation will be aborted.
Any changes made to the work tree up to this point will be left behind.
Such changes can be viewed with
.Cm got diff
and can be reverted with
.Cm got revert
if needed.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got patch
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar commit
Attempt to locate files within the specified
.Ar commit
for use as a merge-base for 3-way merges.
Ideally, the specified
.Ar commit
should contain versions of files which the changes contained in the
.Ar patchfile
were based on.
Files will be located by path, relative to the repository root.
If the
.Fl p
option is used then leading path components will be stripped
before paths are looked up in the repository.
.Pp
If the
.Fl c
option is not used then
.Cm got patch
will attempt to locate merge-bases via object IDs found in
.Ar patchfile
meta-data, such as produced by
.Cm got diff
or
.Xr git-diff 1 .
Use of the
.Fl c
option is only recommended in the absence of such meta-data.
.Pp
In case no merge-base is available for a file, changes will be applied
without doing a 3-way merge.
Changes which do not apply cleanly may then be rejected entirely, rather
than producing merge conflicts in the patched target file.
.It Fl n
Do not make any modifications to the work tree.
This can be used to check whether a patch would apply without issues.
If the
.Ar patchfile
contains diffs that affect the same file multiple times, the results
displayed may be incorrect.
.It Fl p Ar strip-count
Specify the number of leading path components to strip from paths
parsed from
.Ar patchfile .
If the
.Fl p
option is not used,
.Sq a/
and
.Sq b/
path prefixes generated by
.Xr git-diff 1
will be recognized and stripped automatically.
.It Fl R
Reverse the patch before applying it.
.El
.Tg rv
.It Xo
.Cm revert
.Op Fl pR
.Op Fl F Ar response-script
.Ar path ...
.Xc
.Dl Pq alias: Cm rv
Revert any local changes in files at the specified paths in a work tree.
File contents will be overwritten with those contained in the
work tree's base commit.
There is no way to bring discarded changes back after
.Cm got revert !
.Pp
If a file was added with
.Cm got add ,
it will become an unversioned file again.
If a file was deleted with
.Cm got remove ,
it will be restored.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got revert
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl F Ar response-script
With the
.Fl p
option, read
.Dq y ,
.Dq n ,
and
.Dq q
responses line-by-line from the specified
.Ar response-script
file instead of prompting interactively.
.It Fl p
Instead of reverting all changes in files, interactively select or reject
changes to revert based on
.Dq y
(revert change),
.Dq n
(keep change), and
.Dq q
(quit reverting this file) responses.
If a file is in modified status, individual patches derived from the
modified file content can be reverted.
Files in added or deleted status may only be reverted in their entirety.
.It Fl R
Permit recursion into directories.
If this option is not specified,
.Cm got revert
will refuse to run if a specified
.Ar path
is a directory.

Create a new commit in the repository from changes in a work tree
and use this commit as the new base commit for the work tree.
If no
.Ar path
is specified, commit all changes in the work tree.
Otherwise, commit changes at or within the specified paths.
.Pp
If changes have been explicitly staged for commit with
.Cm got stage ,
only commit staged changes and reject any specified paths which
have not been staged.
.Pp
.Cm got commit
opens a temporary file in an editor where a log message can be written
unless the
.Fl m
option is used
or the
.Fl F
and
.Fl N
options are used together.
.Pp
Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It M Ta modified file
.It D Ta file was deleted
.It A Ta new file was added
.It m Ta modified file modes (executable bit only)
.El
.Pp
Files which are not part of the new commit will retain their previously
recorded base commit.
Some
.Nm
commands may refuse to run while the work tree contains files from
multiple base commits.
The base commit of such a work tree can be made consistent by running
.Cm got update
across the entire work tree.
.Pp
The
.Cm got commit
command requires the
.Ev GOT_AUTHOR
environment variable to be set,
unless an author has been configured in
.Xr got.conf 5
or Git's
.Dv user.name
and
.Dv user.email
configuration settings can be
obtained from the repository's
.Pa .git/config
file or from Git's global
.Pa ~/.gitconfig
configuration file.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got commit
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A Ar author
Set author information in the newly created commit to
.Ar author .
This is useful when committing changes which were written by someone
else.
The
.Ar author
argument must use the same format as the
.Ev GOT_AUTHOR
environment variable.
.Pp
In addition to storing author information, the newly created commit
object will retain
.Dq committer
information which is obtained, as usual, from the
.Ev GOT_AUTHOR
environment variable, or
.Xr got.conf 5 ,
or Git configuration settings.
.It Fl F Ar path
Use the prepared log message stored in the file found at
.Ar path
when creating the new commit.
.Cm got commit
opens a temporary file in an editor where the prepared log message can be
reviewed and edited further if needed.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl m
option.
.It Fl m Ar message
Use the specified log message when creating the new commit.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl F
option.
.It Fl N
This option prevents
.Cm got commit
from opening the commit message in an editor.
It has no effect unless it is used together with the
.Fl F
option and is intended for non-interactive use such as scripting.
.It Fl n
This option prevents
.Cm got commit
from generating a diff of the to-be-committed changes in a temporary file
which can be viewed while editing a commit message.
.It Fl S
Allow the addition of symbolic links which point outside of the path space
that is under version control.
By default,
.Cm got commit
will reject such symbolic links due to safety concerns.
As a precaution,
.Nm
may decide to represent such a symbolic link as a regular file which contains
the link's target path, rather than creating an actual symbolic link which
points outside of the work tree.
Use of this option is discouraged because external mechanisms such as
.Dq make obj
are better suited for managing symbolic links to paths not under
version control.
.El
.Pp
.Cm got commit
will refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.
If the work tree's current branch is not in the
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace, new commits may not be created on this branch.
Local changes may only be committed if they are based on file content
found in the most recent commit on the work tree's branch.
If a path is found to be out of date,
.Cm got update
must be used first in order to merge local changes with changes made
in the repository.

Send new changes to a remote repository.
If no

is specified,
.Dq origin
will be used.
The remote repository's URL is obtained from the corresponding entry in
.Xr got.conf 5
or Git's
.Pa config
file of the local repository, as created by
.Cm got clone .
.Pp
All objects corresponding to new changes will be written to a temporary
pack file which is then uploaded to the server.
Upon success, references in the
.Dq refs/remotes/
reference namespace of the local repository will be updated to point at
the commits which have been sent.
.Pp
By default, changes will only be sent if they are based on up-to-date
copies of relevant branches in the remote repository.
If any changes to be sent are based on out-of-date copies or would
otherwise break linear history of existing branches, new changes must
be fetched from the server with
.Cm got fetch
and local branches must be rebased with
.Cm got rebase
before
.Cm got send
can succeed.
The
.Fl f
option can be used to make exceptions to these requirements.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got send
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Send all branches from the local repository's
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace.
The
.Fl a
option is equivalent to listing all branches with multiple
.Fl b
options.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl b
option.
.It Fl b Ar branch
Send the specified
.Ar branch
from the local repository's
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace.
This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of branches
to send.
If this option is not specified, default to the work tree's current branch
if invoked in a work tree, or to the repository's HEAD reference.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl a
option.
.It Fl d Ar branch
Delete the specified
.Ar branch
from the remote repository's
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace.
This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of branches
to delete.
.Pp
Only references are deleted.
Any commit, tree, tag, and blob objects belonging to deleted branches
may become subject to deletion by Git's garbage collector running on
the server.
.Pp
Requesting deletion of branches results in an error if the server
does not support this feature or disallows the deletion of branches
based on its configuration.
.It Fl f
Attempt to force the server to overwrite existing branches or tags
in the remote repository, even when
.Cm got fetch
and
.Cm got rebase
would usually be required before changes can be sent.
The server may reject forced requests regardless, depending on its
configuration.
.Pp
Any commit, tree, tag, and blob objects belonging to overwritten branches
or tags may become subject to deletion by Git's garbage collector running
on the server.
.Pp
The
.Dq refs/tags
reference namespace is globally shared between all repositories.
Use of the
.Fl f
option to overwrite tags is discouraged because it can lead to
inconsistencies between the tags present in different repositories.
In general, creating a new tag with a different name is recommended
instead of overwriting an existing tag.
.Pp
Use of the
.Fl f
option is particularly discouraged if changes being sent are based
on an out-of-date copy of a branch in the remote repository.
Instead of using the
.Fl f
option, new changes should
be fetched with
.Cm got fetch
and local branches should be rebased with
.Cm got rebase ,
followed by another attempt to send the changes.
.Pp
The
.Fl f
option should only be needed in situations where the remote repository's
copy of a branch or tag is known to be out-of-date and is considered
disposable.
The risks of creating inconsistencies between different repositories
should also be taken into account.
.It Fl q
Suppress progress reporting output.
The same option will be passed to
.Xr ssh 1
if applicable.
.It Fl r Ar repository-path
Use the repository at the specified path.
If not specified, assume the repository is located at or above the current
working directory.
If this directory is a
.Nm
work tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.
.It Fl T
Attempt to send all tags from the local repository's
.Dq refs/tags/
reference namespace.
The
.Fl T
option is equivalent to listing all tags with multiple
.Fl t
options.
Cannot be used together with the
.Fl t
option.
.It Fl t Ar tag
Send the specified
.Ar tag
from the local repository's
.Dq refs/tags/
reference namespace, in addition to any branches that are being sent.
The
.Fl t
option may be specified multiple times to build a list of tags to send.
No tags will be sent if the
.Fl t
option is not used.
.Pp
Raise an error if the specified
.Ar tag
already exists in the remote repository, unless the
.Fl f
option is used to overwrite the server's copy of the tag.
In general, creating a new tag with a different name is recommended
instead of overwriting an existing tag.

.Cm rebase
.Op Fl aclX
.Op Ar branch
.Xc
.Dl Pq alias: Cm rb
Rebase commits on the specified
.Ar branch
onto the tip of the current branch of the work tree.
The
.Ar branch
must share common ancestry with the work tree's current branch.
Rebasing begins with the first descendant commit of the youngest
common ancestor commit shared by the specified
.Ar branch
and the work tree's current branch, and stops once the tip commit
of the specified
.Ar branch
has been rebased.
.Pp
When
.Cm got rebase
is used as intended, the specified
.Ar branch
represents a local commit history and may already contain changes
that are not yet visible in any other repositories.
The work tree's current branch, which must be set with
.Cm got update -b
before starting the
.Cm rebase
operation, represents a branch from a remote repository which shares
a common history with the specified
.Ar branch
but has progressed, and perhaps diverged, due to commits added to the
remote repository.
.Pp
Rebased commits are accumulated on a temporary branch which the work tree
will remain switched to throughout the entire rebase operation.
Commits on this branch represent the same changes with the same log
messages as their counterparts on the original
.Ar branch ,
but with different commit IDs.
Once rebasing has completed successfully, the temporary branch becomes
the new version of the specified
.Ar branch
and the work tree is automatically switched to it.
If author information is available via the
.Ev GOT_AUTHOR
environment variable,
.Xr got.conf 5
or Git's
.Dv user.name
and
.Dv user.email
configuration settings, this author information will be used to identify
the
.Dq committer
of rebased commits.
.Pp
Old commits in their pre-rebase state are automatically backed up in the
.Dq refs/got/backup/rebase
reference namespace.
As long as these references are not removed older versions of rebased
commits will remain in the repository and can be viewed with the
.Cm got rebase -l
command.
Removal of these references makes objects which become unreachable via
any reference subject to removal by Git's garbage collector or
.Cm gotadmin cleanup .
.Pp
While rebasing commits, show the status of each affected file,
using the following status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It G Ta file was merged
.It C Ta file was merged and conflicts occurred during merge
.It ! Ta changes destined for a missing file were not merged
.It D Ta file was deleted
.It d Ta file's deletion was prevented by local modifications
.It A Ta new file was added
.It \(a~ Ta changes destined for a non-regular file were not merged
.It ? Ta changes destined for an unversioned file were not merged
.El
.Pp
If merge conflicts occur, the rebase operation is interrupted and may
be continued once conflicts have been resolved.
If any files with destined changes are found to be missing or unversioned,
or if files could not be deleted due to differences in deleted content,
the rebase operation will be interrupted to prevent potentially incomplete
changes from being committed to the repository without user intervention.
The work tree may be modified as desired and the rebase operation can be
continued once the changes present in the work tree are considered complete.
Alternatively, the rebase operation may be aborted which will leave
.Ar branch
unmodified and the work tree switched back to its original branch.
.Pp
If a merge conflict is resolved in a way which renders the merged
change into a no-op change, the corresponding commit will be elided
when the rebase operation continues.
.Pp
.Cm got rebase
will refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.
If the
.Ar branch
is not in the
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace, the branch may not be rebased.
If the work tree is not yet fully updated to the tip commit of its
branch, then the work tree must first be updated with
.Cm got update .
If changes have been staged with
.Cm got stage ,
these changes must first be committed with
.Cm got commit
or unstaged with
.Cm got unstage .
If the work tree contains local changes, these changes must first be
committed with
.Cm got commit
or reverted with
.Cm got revert .
If the
.Ar branch
contains changes to files outside of the work tree's path prefix,
the work tree cannot be used to rebase this branch.
.Pp
The
.Cm got update ,
.Cm got integrate ,
.Cm got merge ,
.Cm got commit ,
and
.Cm got histedit
commands will refuse to run while a rebase operation is in progress.
Other commands which manipulate the work tree may be used for
conflict resolution purposes.
.Pp
If the specified
.Ar branch
is already based on the work tree's current branch, then no commits
need to be rebased and
.Cm got rebase
will simply switch the work tree to the specified
.Ar branch
and update files in the work tree accordingly.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got rebase
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Abort an interrupted rebase operation.
If this option is used, no other command-line arguments are allowed.
.It Fl c
Continue an interrupted rebase operation.
If this option is used, no other command-line arguments are allowed.
.It Fl l
Show a list of past rebase operations, represented by references in the
.Dq refs/got/backup/rebase
reference namespace.
.Pp
Display the author, date, and log message of each backed up commit,
the object ID of the corresponding post-rebase commit, and
the object ID of their common ancestor commit.
Given these object IDs,
the
.Cm got log
command with the
.Fl c
and
.Fl x
options can be used to examine the history of either version of the branch,
and the
.Cm got branch
command with the
.Fl c
option can be used to create a new branch from a pre-rebase state if desired.
.Pp
If a
.Ar branch
is specified, only show commits which at some point in time represented this
branch.
Otherwise, list all backed up commits for any branches.
.Pp
If this option is used,
.Cm got rebase
does not require a work tree.
None of the other options can be used together with
.Fl l .
.It Fl X
Delete backups created by past rebase operations, represented by references
in the
.Dq refs/got/backup/rebase
reference namespace.
.Pp
If a

is specified, only delete backups which at some point in time represented
this branch.
Otherwise, delete all references found within
.Dq refs/got/backup/rebase .
.Pp
Any commit, tree, tag, and blob objects belonging to deleted backups
remain in the repository and may be removed separately with
Git's garbage collector or
.Cm gotadmin cleanup .

.Xc
.Dl Pq alias: Cm he
Edit commit history between the work tree's current base commit and
the tip commit of the work tree's current branch.
.Pp
The
.Cm got histedit
command requires the
.Ev GOT_AUTHOR
environment variable to be set,
unless an author has been configured in
.Xr got.conf 5
or Git's
.Dv user.name
and
.Dv user.email
configuration settings can be obtained from the repository's
.Pa .git/config
file or from Git's global
.Pa ~/.gitconfig
configuration file.
.Pp
Before starting a
.Cm histedit
operation, the work tree's current branch must be set with
.Cm got update -b
to the branch which should be edited, unless this branch is already the
current branch of the work tree.
The tip of this branch represents the upper bound (inclusive) of commits
touched by the
.Cm histedit
operation.
.Pp
Furthermore, the work tree's base commit
must be set with
.Cm got update -c
to a point in this branch's commit history where editing should begin.
This commit represents the lower bound (non-inclusive) of commits touched
by the
.Cm histedit
operation.
.Pp
Editing of commit history is controlled via a
.Ar histedit script
which can be written in an editor based on a template, passed on the
command line, or generated with the
.Fl f
or
.Fl m
options.
.Pp
The format of the histedit script is line-based.
Each line in the script begins with a command name, followed by
whitespace and an argument.
For most commands, the expected argument is a commit ID SHA1 hash.
Any remaining text on the line is ignored.
Lines which begin with the
.Sq #
character are ignored entirely.
.Pp
The available histedit script commands are as follows:
.Bl -column YXZ pick-commit
.It Cm pick Ar commit Ta Use the specified commit as it is.
.It Cm edit Ar commit Ta Use the specified commit but once changes have been
merged into the work tree interrupt the histedit operation for amending.
.It Cm fold Ar commit Ta Combine the specified commit with the next commit
listed further below that will be used.
.It Cm drop Ar commit Ta Remove this commit from the edited history.
.It Cm mesg Oo Ar log-message Oc Ta Create a new log message for the commit of
a preceding
.Cm pick
or
.Cm edit
command on the previous line of the histedit script.
The optional
.Ar log-message
argument provides a new single-line log message to use.
If the
.Ar log-message
argument is omitted, open an editor where a new log message can be written.
.El
.Pp
Every commit in the history being edited must be mentioned in the script.
Lines may be re-ordered to change the order of commits in the edited history.
No commit may be listed more than once.
.Pp
Edited commits are accumulated on a temporary branch which the work tree
will remain switched to throughout the entire histedit operation.
Once history editing has completed successfully, the temporary branch becomes
the new version of the work tree's branch and the work tree is automatically
switched to it.
.Pp
Old commits in their pre-histedit state are automatically backed up in the
.Dq refs/got/backup/histedit
reference namespace.
As long as these references are not removed older versions of edited
commits will remain in the repository and can be viewed with the
.Cm got histedit -l
command.
Removal of these references makes objects which become unreachable via
any reference subject to removal by Git's garbage collector or
.Cm gotadmin cleanup .
.Pp
While merging commits, show the status of each affected file,
using the following status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It G Ta file was merged
.It C Ta file was merged and conflicts occurred during merge
.It ! Ta changes destined for a missing file were not merged
.It D Ta file was deleted
.It d Ta file's deletion was prevented by local modifications
.It A Ta new file was added
.It \(a~ Ta changes destined for a non-regular file were not merged
.It ? Ta changes destined for an unversioned file were not merged
.El
.Pp
If merge conflicts occur, the histedit operation is interrupted and may
be continued once conflicts have been resolved.
If any files with destined changes are found to be missing or unversioned,
or if files could not be deleted due to differences in deleted content,
the histedit operation will be interrupted to prevent potentially incomplete
changes from being committed to the repository without user intervention.
The work tree may be modified as desired and the histedit operation can be
continued once the changes present in the work tree are considered complete.
Alternatively, the histedit operation may be aborted which will leave
the work tree switched back to its original branch.
.Pp
If a merge conflict is resolved in a way which renders the merged
change into a no-op change, the corresponding commit will be elided
when the histedit operation continues.
.Pp
.Cm got histedit
will refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.
If the work tree's current branch is not in the
.Dq refs/heads/
reference namespace, the history of the branch may not be edited.
If the work tree contains multiple base commits, it must first be updated
to a single base commit with
.Cm got update .
If changes have been staged with
.Cm got stage ,
these changes must first be committed with
.Cm got commit
or unstaged with
.Cm got unstage .
If the work tree contains local changes, these changes must first be
committed with
.Cm got commit
or reverted with
.Cm got revert .
If the edited history contains changes to files outside of the work tree's
path prefix, the work tree cannot be used to edit the history of this branch.
.Pp
The
.Cm got update ,
.Cm got rebase ,
.Cm got merge ,
and
.Cm got integrate
commands will refuse to run while a histedit operation is in progress.
Other commands which manipulate the work tree may be used, and the

option can only be used when starting a new histedit operation.
If this option is used, no other command-line arguments are allowed.
.It Fl e
Interrupt the histedit operation for editing after merging each commit.
This option is a quick equivalent to a histedit script which uses the

Otherwise, list all backed up commits for any branches.
.Pp
If this option is used,
.Cm got histedit
does not require a work tree.
None of the other options can be used together with
.Fl l .
.It Fl m
Edit log messages only.
This option is a quick equivalent to a histedit script which edits
only log messages but otherwise leaves every picked commit as-is.
The
.Fl m
option can only be used when starting a new histedit operation.
If this option is used, no other command-line arguments are allowed.

Files in the work tree are updated to match the contents on the integrated
.Ar branch ,
and the reference of the work tree's branch is changed to point at the
head commit of the integrated

.Pp
Both branches can be considered equivalent after integration since they
will be pointing at the same commit.
Both branches remain available for future work, if desired.
In case the integrated

.Pp
.Cm got integrate
will refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.
Most importantly, the
.Ar branch
must have been rebased onto the work tree's current branch with
.Cm got rebase
before it can be integrated, in order to linearize commit history and
resolve merge conflicts.
If the work tree contains multiple base commits, it must first be updated
to a single base commit with
.Cm got update .
If changes have been staged with
.Cm got stage ,
these changes must first be committed with

If a linear project history is desired, then use of
.Cm got rebase
should be preferred over
.Cm got merge .
However, even strictly linear projects may require merge commits in order
to merge in new versions of third-party code stored on vendor branches
created with
.Cm got import .
.Pp
Merge commits are commits based on multiple parent commits.
The tip commit of the work tree's current branch, which must be set with
.Cm got update -b
before starting the
.Cm merge
operation, will be used as the first parent.
The tip commit of the specified
.Ar branch
will be used as the second parent.
.Pp
No ancestral relationship between the two branches is required.
If the two branches have already been merged previously, only new changes
will be merged.
.Pp
It is not possible to create merge commits with more than two parents.
If more than one branch needs to be merged, then multiple merge commits
with two parents each can be created in sequence.
.Pp
While merging changes found on the
.Ar branch
into the work tree, show the status of each affected file,
using the following status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description

.It \(a~ Ta changes destined for a non-regular file were not merged
.It ? Ta changes destined for an unversioned file were not merged
.El
.Pp
If merge conflicts occur, the merge operation is interrupted and conflicts
must be resolved before the merge operation can continue.
If any files with destined changes are found to be missing or unversioned,
or if files could not be deleted due to differences in deleted content,
the merge operation will be interrupted to prevent potentially incomplete
changes from being committed to the repository without user intervention.
The work tree may be modified as desired and the merge can be continued
once the changes present in the work tree are considered complete.
Alternatively, the merge operation may be aborted which will leave
the work tree's current branch unmodified.
.Pp
If a merge conflict is resolved in a way which renders all merged
changes into no-op changes, the merge operation cannot continue
and must be aborted.
.Pp
.Cm got merge
will refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.
If history of the
.Ar branch
is based on the work tree's current branch, then no merge commit can
be created and
.Cm got integrate
may be used to integrate the
.Ar branch
instead.
If the work tree is not yet fully updated to the tip commit of its
branch, then the work tree must first be updated with
.Cm got update .
If the work tree contains multiple base commits, it must first be updated
to a single base commit with
.Cm got update .
If changes have been staged with

Staged file contents are saved in newly created blob objects in the repository.
These blobs will be referred to by tree objects once staged changes have been
committed.
.Pp
Staged changes affect the behaviour of
.Cm got commit ,
.Cm got status ,
and
.Cm got diff .
While paths with staged changes exist, the
.Cm got commit
command will refuse to commit any paths which do not have staged changes.
Local changes created on top of staged changes can only be committed if
the path is staged again, or if the staged changes are committed first.
The
.Cm got status
command will show both local changes and staged changes.
The
.Cm got diff
command is able to display local changes relative to staged changes,
and to display staged changes relative to the repository.
The
.Cm got revert
command cannot revert staged changes but may be used to revert
local changes created on top of staged changes.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got stage
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl F Ar response-script
With the
.Fl p
option, read
.Dq y ,
.Dq n ,
and
.Dq q
responses line-by-line from the specified
.Ar response-script
file instead of prompting interactively.
.It Fl l
Instead of staging new changes, list paths which are already staged,
along with the IDs of staged blob objects and stage status codes.
If paths were provided on the command line, show the staged paths
among the specified paths.
Otherwise, show all staged paths.
.It Fl p
Instead of staging the entire content of a changed file, interactively
select or reject changes for staging based on
.Dq y
(stage change),
.Dq n
(reject change), and
.Dq q
(quit staging this file) responses.
If a file is in modified status, individual patches derived from the
modified file content can be staged.
Files in added or deleted status may only be staged or rejected in
their entirety.
.It Fl S
Allow staging of symbolic links which point outside of the path space
that is under version control.
By default,
.Cm got stage
will reject such symbolic links due to safety concerns.
As a precaution,
.Nm
may decide to represent such a symbolic link as a regular file which contains
the link's target path, rather than creating an actual symbolic link which
points outside of the work tree.
Use of this option is discouraged because external mechanisms such as
.Dq make obj
are better suited for managing symbolic links to paths not under
version control.
.El
.Pp
.Cm got stage
will refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.
If a file contains merge conflicts, these conflicts must be resolved first.
If a file is found to be out of date relative to the head commit on the
work tree's current branch, the file must be updated with
.Cm got update
before it can be staged (however, this does not prevent the file from
becoming out-of-date at some point after having been staged).
.Pp
The
.Cm got update ,
.Cm got rebase ,
and
.Cm got histedit
commands will refuse to run while staged changes exist.
If staged changes cannot be committed because a staged path
is out of date, the path must be unstaged with
.Cm got unstage
before it can be updated with
.Cm got update ,
and may then be staged again if necessary.
.Tg ug

.Dl Pq alias: Cm ug
Merge staged changes back into the work tree and put affected paths
back into non-staged status.
If no
.Ar path
is specified, unstage all staged changes across the entire work tree.
Otherwise, unstage changes at or within the specified paths.
.Pp
Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:
.Bl -column YXZ description
.It G Ta file was unstaged
.It C Ta file was unstaged and conflicts occurred during merge
.It ! Ta changes destined for a missing file were not merged
.It D Ta file was staged as deleted and still is deleted
.It d Ta file's deletion was prevented by local modifications
.It \(a~ Ta changes destined for a non-regular file were not merged
.El
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got unstage
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl F Ar response-script
With the
.Fl p
option, read
.Dq y ,
.Dq n ,
and
.Dq q
responses line-by-line from the specified
.Ar response-script
file instead of prompting interactively.
.It Fl p
Instead of unstaging the entire content of a changed file, interactively
select or reject changes for unstaging based on
.Dq y
(unstage change),
.Dq n
(keep change staged), and
.Dq q
(quit unstaging this file) responses.
If a file is staged in modified status, individual patches derived from the
staged file content can be unstaged.
Files staged in added or deleted status may only be unstaged in their entirety.
.El

.Cm cat
.Op Fl P
.Op Fl c Ar commit

.Ar arg ...
.Xc
Parse and print contents of objects to standard output in a line-based
text format.
Content of commit, tree, and tag objects is printed in a way similar
to the actual content stored in such objects.
Blob object contents are printed as they would appear in files on disk.
.Pp
Attempt to interpret each argument as a reference, a tag name, or
an object ID SHA1 hash.
References will be resolved to an object ID.
Tag names will resolved to a tag object.
An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full SHA1 hash
automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.
.Pp
If none of the above interpretations produce a valid result, or if the
.Fl P
option is used, attempt to interpret the argument as a path which will
be resolved to the ID of an object found at this path in the repository.
.Pp
The options for
.Cm got cat
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar commit
Look up paths in the specified
.Ar commit .
If this option is not used, paths are looked up in the commit resolved
via the repository's HEAD reference.
The expected argument is a commit ID SHA1 hash or an existing reference
or tag name which will be resolved to a commit ID.
An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full SHA1 hash
automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.
.It Fl P
Interpret all arguments as paths only.
This option can be used to resolve ambiguity in cases where paths
look like tag names, reference names, or object IDs.
.It Fl r Ar repository-path
Use the repository at the specified path.
If not specified, assume the repository is located at or above the current
working directory.
If this directory is a
.Nm
work tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.
.El
.It Cm info Op Ar path ...
Display meta-data stored in a work tree.
See
.Xr got-worktree 5

.Pp
The work tree to use is resolved implicitly by walking upwards from the
current working directory.
.Pp
If one or more
.Ar path
arguments are specified, show additional per-file information for tracked
files located at or within these paths.
If a
.Ar path
argument corresponds to the work tree's root directory, display information
for all tracked files.

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width GOT_IGNORE_GITCONFIG

The author's name and email address, such as
.Dq An Flan Hacker Aq Mt flan_hacker@openbsd.org .
Used by the
.Cm got commit ,
.Cm got import ,
.Cm got rebase ,
and
.Cm got histedit
commands.
Because
.Xr git 1
may fail to parse commits without an email address in author data,
.Nm
attempts to reject
.Ev GOT_AUTHOR
environment variables with a missing email address.
.Pp
.Ev GOT_AUTHOR will be overridden by configuration settings in
.Xr got.conf 5
or by Git's
.Dv user.name
and
.Dv user.email
configuration settings in the repository's
.Pa .git/config
file.
The
.Dv user.name
and
.Dv user.email
configuration settings contained in Git's global
.Pa ~/.gitconfig
configuration file will only be used if neither
.Xr got.conf 5
nor the
.Ev GOT_AUTHOR
environment variable provide author information.
.It Ev GOT_IGNORE_GITCONFIG
If this variable is set then any remote repository definitions or author
information found in Git configuration files will be ignored.
.It Ev GOT_LOG_DEFAULT_LIMIT
The default limit on the number of commits traversed by
.Cm got log .
If set to zero, the limit is unbounded.
This variable will be silently ignored if it is set to a non-numeric value.
.It Ev VISUAL , EDITOR
The editor spawned by

.Pp
.Dl $ set -A complete_got_1 -- $(got -h 2>&1 | sed -n s/commands://p)
.Pp
Clone an existing Git repository for use with
.Nm .
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /var/git/
.Dl $ got clone ssh://git@github.com/openbsd/src.git
.Pp
Use of HTTP URLs currently requires
.Xr git 1 :
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /var/git/
.Dl $ git clone --bare https://github.com/openbsd/src.git
.Pp
Alternatively, for quick and dirty local testing of
.Nm
a new Git repository could be created and populated with files,
e.g. from a temporary CVS checkout located at
.Pa /tmp/src :
.Pp
.Dl $ gotadmin init /var/git/src.git
.Dl $ got import -r /var/git/src.git -I CVS -I obj /tmp/src
.Pp
Check out a work tree from the Git repository to /usr/src:
.Pp
.Dl $ got checkout /var/git/src.git /usr/src
.Pp
View local changes in a work tree directory:
.Pp
.Dl $ got diff | less
.Pp
In a work tree, display files in a potentially problematic state:
.Pp
.Dl $ got status -s 'C!~?'
.Pp
Interactively revert selected local changes in a work tree directory:
.Pp
.Dl $ got revert -p -R\ .
.Pp
In a work tree or a git repository directory, list all branch references:
.Pp
.Dl $ got branch -l
.Pp
As above, but list the most recently modified branches only:
.Pp
.Dl $ got branch -lt | head
.Pp
In a work tree or a git repository directory, create a new branch called
.Dq unified-buffer-cache
which is forked off the
.Dq master
branch:
.Pp
.Dl $ got branch -c master unified-buffer-cache
.Pp
Switch an existing work tree to the branch
.Dq unified-buffer-cache .
Local changes in the work tree will be preserved and merged if necessary:
.Pp
.Dl $ got update -b unified-buffer-cache
.Pp
Create a new commit from local changes in a work tree directory.
This new commit will become the head commit of the work tree's current branch:
.Pp
.Dl $ got commit
.Pp
In a work tree or a git repository directory, view changes committed in
the 3 most recent commits to the work tree's branch, or the branch resolved
via the repository's HEAD reference, respectively:
.Pp
.Dl $ got log -p -l 3
.Pp
As above, but display changes in the order in which
.Xr patch 1
could apply them in sequence:
.Pp
.Dl $ got log -p -l 3 -R
.Pp
In a work tree or a git repository directory, log the history of a subdirectory:
.Pp
.Dl $ got log sys/uvm
.Pp
While operating inside a work tree, paths are specified relative to the current
working directory, so this command will log the subdirectory
.Pa sys/uvm :
.Pp
.Dl $ cd sys/uvm && got log\ .
.Pp
And this command has the same effect:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd sys/dev/usb && got log ../../uvm
.Pp
And this command displays work tree meta-data about all tracked files:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /usr/src
.Dl $ got info\ . | less
.Pp
Add new files and remove obsolete files in a work tree directory:
.Pp
.Dl $ got add sys/uvm/uvm_ubc.c
.Dl $ got remove sys/uvm/uvm_vnode.c
.Pp
Create a new commit from local changes in a work tree directory
with a pre-defined log message.
.Pp
.Dl $ got commit -m 'unify the buffer cache'
.Pp
Alternatively, create a new commit from local changes in a work tree
directory with a log message that has been prepared in the file
.Pa /tmp/msg :
.Pp
.Dl $ got commit -F /tmp/msg
.Pp
Update any work tree checked out from the
.Dq unified-buffer-cache
branch to the latest commit on this branch:
.Pp
.Dl $ got update
.Pp
Roll file content on the unified-buffer-cache branch back by one commit,
and then fetch the rolled-back change into the work tree as a local change
to be amended and perhaps committed again:
.Pp
.Dl $ got backout unified-buffer-cache
.Dl $ got commit -m 'roll back previous'
.Dl $ # now back out the previous backout :-)
.Dl $ got backout unified-buffer-cache
.Pp
Fetch new changes on the remote repository's
.Dq master
branch, making them visible on the local repository's
.Dq origin/master
branch:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /usr/src
.Dl $ got fetch
.Pp
In a repository created with a HTTP URL and
.Cm git clone --bare
the
.Xr git-fetch 1
command must be used instead:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /var/git/src.git
.Dl $ git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/master
.Pp
Rebase the local
.Dq master
branch to merge the new changes that are now visible on the
.Dq origin/master
branch:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /usr/src
.Dl $ got update -b origin/master
.Dl $ got rebase master
.Pp
Rebase the
.Dq unified-buffer-cache
branch on top of the new head commit of the
.Dq master
branch.
.Pp
.Dl $ got update -b master
.Dl $ got rebase unified-buffer-cache
.Pp
Create a patch from all changes on the unified-buffer-cache branch.
The patch can be mailed out for review and applied to
.Ox Ns 's
CVS tree:
.Pp
.Dl $ got diff master unified-buffer-cache > /tmp/ubc.diff
.Pp
Edit the entire commit history of the
.Dq unified-buffer-cache
branch:
.Pp
.Dl $ got update -b unified-buffer-cache
.Dl $ got update -c master
.Dl $ got histedit
.Pp
Before working against existing branches in a repository cloned with
.Cm git clone --bare
instead of
.Cm got clone ,
a Git
.Dq refspec
must be configured to map all references in the remote repository
into the
.Dq refs/remotes
namespace of the local repository.
This can be achieved by setting Git's
.Pa remote.origin.fetch
configuration variable to the value
.Dq +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
with the
.Cm git config
command:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /var/git/repo
.Dl $ git config remote.origin.fetch '+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*'
.Pp
Additionally, the
.Dq mirror
option must be disabled:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /var/git/repo
.Dl $ git config remote.origin.mirror false
.Pp
Alternatively, the following
.Xr git-fetch 1
configuration item can be added manually to the Git repository's
.Pa config
file:
.Pp
.Dl [remote \&"origin\&"]
.Dl url = ...
.Dl fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
.Dl mirror = false
.Pp
This configuration leaves the local repository's
.Dq refs/heads
namespace free for use by local branches checked out with
.Cm got checkout
and, if needed, created with
.Cm got branch .
Branches in the
.Dq refs/remotes/origin
namespace can now be updated with incoming changes from the remote
repository with
.Cm got fetch
or
.Xr git-fetch 1
without extra command line arguments.
Newly fetched changes can be examined with
.Cm got log .
.Pp
Display changes on the remote repository's version of the
.Dq master
branch, as of the last time
.Cm got fetch
was run:
.Pp
.Dl $ got log -c origin/master | less
.Pp
As shown here, most commands accept abbreviated reference names such as
.Dq origin/master
instead of
.Dq refs/remotes/origin/master .
The latter is only needed in case of ambiguity.
.Pp
.Cm got rebase
must be used to merge changes which are visible on the
.Dq origin/master
branch into the
.Dq master
branch.
This will also merge local changes, if any, with the incoming changes:
.Pp
.Dl $ got update -b origin/master
.Dl $ got rebase master
.Pp
In order to make changes committed to the
.Dq unified-buffer-cache
visible on the
.Dq master
branch, the
.Dq unified-buffer-cache
branch must first be rebased onto the
.Dq master
branch:
.Pp
.Dl $ got update -b master
.Dl $ got rebase unified-buffer-cache
.Pp
Changes on the
.Dq unified-buffer-cache
branch can now be made visible on the
.Dq master
branch with
.Cm got integrate .
Because the rebase operation switched the work tree to the
.Dq unified-buffer-cache
branch, the work tree must be switched back to the
.Dq master
branch first:
.Pp
.Dl $ got update -b master
.Dl $ got integrate unified-buffer-cache
.Pp
On the
.Dq master
branch, log messages for local changes can now be amended with
.Dq OK
by other developers and any other important new information:
.Pp
.Dl $ got update -c origin/master
.Dl $ got histedit -m
.Pp
If the remote repository offers write access, local changes on the
.Dq master
branch can be sent to the remote repository with
.Cm got send .
Usually,
.Cm got send
can be run without further arguments.
The arguments shown here match defaults, provided the work tree's
current branch is the
.Dq master
branch:
.Pp
.Dl $ got send -b master origin
.Pp
If the remote repository requires the HTTPS protocol, the
.Xr git-push 1
command must be used instead:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /var/git/src.git
.Dl $ git push origin master
.Pp
When making contributions to projects which use the
.Dq pull request
workflow, SSH protocol repository access needs to be set up first.
Once an account has been created on a Git hosting site it should
be possible to upload a public SSH key for repository access
authentication.
.Pp
The
.Dq pull request
workflow will usually involve two remote repositories.
In the real-life example below, the
.Dq origin
repository was forked from the
.Dq upstream
repository by using the Git hosting site's web interface.
The
.Xr got.conf 5
file in the local repository describes both remote repositories:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Jelmers's repository, which accepts pull requests
remote "upstream" {
	server git@github.com
	protocol ssh
	repository "/jelmer/dulwich"
	branch { "master" }
}

# Stefan's fork, used as the default remote repository
remote "origin" {
	server git@github.com
	protocol ssh
	repository "/stspdotname/dulwich"
	branch { "master" }
}
.Ed
.Pp
With this configuration, Stefan can create commits on
.Dq refs/heads/master
and send them to the
.Dq origin
repository by running:
.Pp
.Dl $ got send -b master origin
.Pp
The changes can now be proposed to Jelmer by opening a pull request
via the Git hosting site's web interface.
If Jelmer requests further changes to be made, additional commits
can be created on the
.Dq master
branch and be added to the pull request by running
.Cd got send
again.
.Pp
If Jelmer prefers additional commits to be
.Dq squashed
then the following commands can be used to achieve this:
.Pp
.Dl $ got update -b master
.Dl $ got update -c origin/master
.Dl $ got histedit -f
.Dl $ got send -f -b master origin
.Pp
Once Jelmer has accepted the pull request, Stefan can fetch the
merged changes, and possibly several other new changes, by running:
.Pp
.Dl $ got fetch upstream
.Pp
The merged changes will now be visible under the reference
.Dq refs/remotes/upstream/master .
The local
.Dq master
branch can now be rebased on top of the latest changes
from upstream:
.Pp
.Dl $ got update -b upstream/master
.Dl $ got rebase master
.Pp
As a final step, the forked repository's copy of the master branch needs
to be kept in sync by sending the new changes there:
.Pp
.Dl $ got send -f -b master origin
.Pp
If multiple pull requests need to be managed in parallel, a separate branch
must be created for each pull request with
.Cm got branch .
Each such branch can then be used as above, in place of
.Dq refs/heads/master .
Changes for any accepted pull requests will still appear under
.Dq refs/remotes/upstream/master,
regardless of which branch was used in the forked repository to
create a pull request.
